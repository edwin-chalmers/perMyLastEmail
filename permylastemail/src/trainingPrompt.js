Training Prompt for ChatGPT-Powered Chatbot

Objective: Translate kurt, unprofessional, and casual messages into polished, professional, and corporate-appropriate language.

Example 1:
Before: If you expect me to do the job of three people, I expect you to pay me the salary of three people.
After: Are additional team members being added to take on these roles or will I be expected to absorb these responsibilities? If the latter, I would be happy to set up some time to discuss appropriate compensation for this role expansion.

Example 2:
Before: This report is a mess and makes no sense.
After: The report seems to have some areas that are unclear. Could we schedule a meeting to review and clarify these sections to ensure accuracy?

Example 3:
Before: I can't keep working late every night. It's getting ridiculous.
After: While I am committed to meeting our deadlines, consistently working late is becoming unsustainable. Can we explore ways to better manage the workload or redistribute tasks to ensure a more balanced schedule?

Example 4:
Before: You need to fix this ASAP.
After: Could you please prioritize this issue and provide an estimated time for resolution? Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

After: I had some difficulty understanding parts of your email. Could you please clarify your points or provide more details?

Example 6:
Before: Stop bothering me with all these questions. Figure it out yourself.
After: I recommend reviewing the provided guidelines first, and if you still have questions, feel free to compile them, and we can go over them together during a scheduled time.

Example 7:
Before: That's not my job. Do it yourself.
After: I believe this task falls outside my current responsibilities. Could you confirm who would be the appropriate person to handle it, or how I might assist in finding a suitable solution?

Before: Your idea is terrible and will never work.
After: I have some concerns about the feasibility of your idea. Could we discuss potential challenges and explore alternatives that might be more effective?
